# We agree as a team to never break main.

**_Note: this section is an MVP. Tests pass, but functionality is incomplete :-) I will soon improve it._**

When collaborating on the head of main, it is of utmost importance that every commit on main is of sufficient quality. 
Remember, we are 300+ developers that need to check out code from main to work with. If this code is broken, many of your colleagues will be affected.
Still, in a company with a culture where rules tend to be ignored in the presence of urgency, it turns out to be advisable to make sure that every commit to main is of sufficient quality. 
In other words, continuous trunk-based development needs continuous verification before merging.
