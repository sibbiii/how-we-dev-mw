# We have a "10 min" build.

Ten minutes is the limit, everything under 5 minutes is better, 30 seconds is plain bonus for engineers, through some have even higher standards ...

Lot of people think that performance is about doing the same thing, just doing it faster. And that's not true. If you can do something really fast really well people start doing things differently!
